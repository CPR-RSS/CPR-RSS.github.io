# Conference Paper Reading RSS.

This is a simple repo for improving (**computer science**) conference paper reading experience. We try to parse the paper information(title, abstract, url) of all the papers for a certain conference and generate an RSS XML file. You can subscribe to our resource to read papers with your **PC/PAD/PHONE** as long as you have an RSS reader on it.

## Usage

You can use **any RSS reader** to subscribe to our resource. In Mac, we recommend using [Leaf](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/leaf-rss-%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB%E5%99%A8/id576338668?mt=12)(**NOTE: most of the emails also support RSS subscription, just Goole it**. btw, use [feedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/) for windows as suggested by [charlesliucn](https://github.com/charlesliucn)). If you are using Leaf, it should look like follows:

### First, subscribe to the resource:

### Second, enjoy reading:

### rss source

Use any rss reading client (Leaf in Mac) to subscribe to the following rss resource.

> Currently, we parse papers from the most recent 2 years. earlier years are not included (but you can run our code to parse it by yourself).

## Dependency

The whole repo is built on `python3`. In this section, we introduce how to run this code locally. This code mainly depends on `requests`, and [`selenium`](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/). Most of the dependencies in this project could be installed via `pip`, except that `selenium`  furtherly requires installing an extra webdriver (`chromedriver` as in the code. You have to install the webdriver locally and put it into your system path).

To run the cod, following the following command:

```shell
python3 main.py -c CONFERENCENAME -y YEAR
```

## Other

1. call for proposals (any suggestion for new conferences, or other interesting functions.)
2. call for pulls of other conferences.
3. pull request: (please make sure that your pull requests meet the following requirement)
   1. satisfies the [python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (The only exception is the Maximum Line Length. In this project, the maximum line length is 100 rather than 80.)
